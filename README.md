- 👋 Hi, I’m @wanwandrew
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology, drugs, nature, skating, music, languages, starting some type of salsa com- well, realistically, I would like 
- to see a rise in p2p networking and observe the uniqueness and creativity for the design websites that typically follows.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Japanese, Russian, how to not freak out in front of other people, bass guitar, flute, skateboarding, inline skating
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming projects, anything involving human languages, music, me learning how to commit without any leg muscles
- 📫 You can reach me at two separate email addresses: goodletta68@gmail.com and agoodlett97@gmail.com. If you see me as a user on a website, I usually go
- by the aliases of wanwan, wanwandrew, or thewxlf. I'm frequently on Final Fantasy 14. I only give out my phone number to hot girls and rich people, but 
- I am not opposed allowing pleb- *ahem* commoners to contact me via this method.
